# Stitch - Final Project
# By Yohannes Dawit

The goal of this project is to create a space in which
designers can upload digital designs of their clothing and display it on
models and different 3D envirnoments

## Deployment

This project have been written in html / three.js.
Open the index.html file using the GoLive Extention on VSCode


## Organization

The file is separated into four subfolders (Myfiles, Threefiles, Resoursces and models) Threefiles contains files that I retreived 
from Three.js repo, My files are files that I created to help aid the scene rendering such as - models, lighting, floorObject. 
Resources and models folder contains models, images and objects that are used for rendering the scene.

Index.html is where you will find the heart of the project and is run out of this file.

## Acknowledgments

* In the scene there is a mirror along the Y axes reflecting the scene horizontally upwards, new modification for the pointLight 
and ambienLight about distance, color and intensity. the .obj object is between the mirrors in order to test their reflection, OrbitControls still normal.

* there is a slight issue between the skybox and the scene which is causing a slight interfacing issue in rendering the clothes materials and reflection at times
